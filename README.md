# Versioning
A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0. [Reference link.](https://semver.org/#spec-item-2)

## Tagging suggestions
It’s common practice to prefix your version names with the letter v. Some good tag names might be v1.0 or v2.3.4.

If the tag isn’t meant for production use, add a pre-release version after the version name. Some good pre-release versions might be v0.2-alpha or v5.9-beta.3.

## Semantic versioning
If you’re new to releasing software, we highly recommend reading about [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).

## Releases / Creating Releases
    
        Note: Only users with write access to the repository can view drafts of releases. For more information, see:

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click Releases.
3. Click Draft a new release.
4. Type a version number for your release. Versions are based on Git tags. We recommend naming tags that fit within semantic versioning.
5. Select a branch that contains the project you want to release. Usually, you'll want to release against your master branch, unless you're releasing beta software.
6. Type a title and description that describes your release.
7. If you'd like to include binary files along with your release, such as compiled programs, drag and drop or select files manually in the binaries box.
8. If the release is unstable, select This is a pre-release to notify users that it's not ready for production.
9. If you're ready to publicize your release, click Publish release. Otherwise, click Save draft to work on it later.
